## Overview

SigNoz is an open-source observability platform that helps you monitor and analyze the performance of your services in real-time. This repository contains ready-to-use dashboard templates in JSON format that can be imported into SigNoz to visualize key metrics and performance indicators for various services.

Each dashboard is built for specific services and data sources like OpenTelemetry (OTLP) and Prometheus. Users can import and modify these dashboards or create new ones based on their needs.

## Adding New Dashboards

To add a new dashboard template for any service, follow the contribution guidelines in the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). In brief:

1. Create a dashboard JSON file following the [Dashboard Naming Convention](#dashboard-naming-convention).
2. Add a README file explaining the dashboard, the metrics ingested, and the configurations needed.
3. Include screenshots of the dashboard in the `assets/` directory.
4. Submit a pull request for review.

## Dashboard Naming Convention

Dashboard JSON files should follow this naming convention:

```
name-of-dashboard-source-version.json
```

- **name-of-dashboard**: The name of the service being monitored (e.g., `mysql-dashboard`).
- **source**: Data source, such as `otlp` or `prometheus`.
- **version**: Start with `v1` for the initial version and increment with future versions (e.g., `v2`, `v3`).

Example: `mysql-dashboard-otlp-v1.json`
