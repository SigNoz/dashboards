## Getting Started

Before you begin, please make sure you have:

- A GitHub account.
- Familiarity with Git for version control.
- Basic understanding of SigNoz and how dashboard templates work.
- Installed any necessary tools for creating and exporting dashboards in JSON format.

## Dashboard JSON File Naming Convention

When adding a new dashboard JSON file, please follow the naming convention below:

```
name-of-dashboard-source-version.json
```

- **name-of-dashboard**: Use lowercase letters and hyphens to separate words.
- **source**: Indicate the data source, such as `otlp` or `prometheus`.
- **version**: Start with `v1` and increment for subsequent versions (`v2`, `v3`, etc.).

**Examples:**

- `mysql-otlp-v1.json`
- `mongodb-prometheus-v1.json`

## Setup SigNoz
If you don't have [SigNoz setup on your local](https://signoz.io/docs/install/docker/) then you get invited to test tenant from us.
1. Join SigNoz [Slack Community](https://signoz.io/slack)
2. Please ping `@vishal-signoz` or ask in the [`#contributing`](https://signoz-community.slack.com/archives/C01LWQ8KS7M) channel in our [Slack Community](https://signoz.io/slack) and we will invite you to test tenant.

## Creating the Dashboard JSON File

1. Create your dashboard in SigNoz according to the guidelines mentioned in the issue. Prefer building panels with [SigNoz Query Builder](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/query-builder/) over custom ClickHouse Query or PromQL
2. Export the dashboard to a JSON file.
3. Ensure that the JSON file follows the naming convention.
4. Place the JSON file in an appropriate subdirectory if one exists.

## Writing the README File

Each dashboard should be accompanied by a README file that provides essential information for users. The README should be clear, concise, and formatted in Markdown.

### README Structure

Your README file should include the following sections:

1. **Title**

   - The title should include the name of the dashboard and the data source.
   - Example: `# MySQL Dashboard - OTLP`

2. **Metrics Ingestion**

   - Explain how to ingest metrics for the dashboard.
   - Provide configuration snippets (e.g., `otel-config.yaml`).
   - Include instructions for setting up receivers and pipelines.

3. **Variables**

   - List and describe any variables used in the dashboard.
   - Example:

     ```markdown
     ## Variables

     - `{{deployment_environment}}`: Deployment environment
     - `{{mysql_instance_endpoint}}`: MySQL instance endpoint
     ```

4. **Dashboard Panels**

   - Describe each section and panel in the dashboard.
   - Mention the metrics used for each panel.
   - Include screenshots stored in the `assets/` directory.

5. **Screenshots**

   - Add relevant screenshots to illustrate the dashboard sections.
   - Reference the images in the README using Markdown syntax.
   - Example:

     ```markdown
     ![Resources Screenshot 1](assets/resources_1.png)
     ```

### Example README

For an example of how your README should look, please refer to the [MySQL Dashboard README](https://github.com/SigNoz/dashboards/blob/main/mysql/readme.md) provided in this repository.

## Adding Screenshots

Screenshots enhance the readability of your README and help users understand the dashboard's appearance and functionality.

- Store all screenshots in the `assets/` directory.
- Name the images using the format `name-of-section.png`.
- Reference the images in your README using relative paths.

**Example:**

```markdown
![Resources Section](assets/resources.png)
```
