# Temporal Dashboard

## Details

This dashboard offers a clear view into Temporal usage and performance. It highlights key metrics such as token consumption, model distribution, error rates, request volumes, and latency trends. Teams can also track which services and languages are leveraging Temporal along with detailed records of errors, to better understand adoption patterns and optimize reliability and efficiency.

To start sending Temporal telemetry to SigNoz, follow the [Temporal monitoring guide](https://signoz.io/docs/temporal-observability/).

## Dashboard panels

### Sections

#### LLM

##### Total Token Usage (Input & Output)

Tokens are the foundation of Temporal. By splitting input tokens (user prompts) and output tokens (model responses), this panel shows exactly how much work the system is doing. Over time, you can monitor efficiency, spot growth in adoption, and balance consumption across workloads.

##### Model Calls

This panel reveals which models are being called most often—helping you track preferences, measure adoption of newer releases, and align usage with performance or cost goals.

##### Token Distribution by Model

This breakdown reveals how token usage is spread across different model variants, helping you identify which models drive the most consumption and optimize your workload distribution for cost and performance.


##### Requests Over Time

Every API call matters. This chart captures the volume of requests sent to Temporal over time, letting you see demand patterns, identify high-traffic windows, and plan infrastructure or cost controls accordingly.

##### Latency (P95 Over Time)
This panel measures the 95th percentile latency of LLM requests over time made through Temporal.

##### Cache Utilization Rate

Caching can dramatically reduce costs and latency by reusing previous responses. This chart tracks how effectively your cache is being utilized over time, revealing opportunities to optimize response times and minimize redundant LLM calls.

##### Services and Languages Using Temporal

A table showing all the services along with their languages that are currently leveraging Temporal. 

##### Number of Requests Over Time

A line chart showing the number of overall requests made to Temporal over time. 

##### HTTP Request Duration (Over Time)

This panel displays a time series line chart of the average HTTP request duration that is being made over time. This gives you insight on the network speed for the actual outbound http request to the API network.

##### Total Error Rate

This panel tracks the percentage of Temporal spans that return errors. It's a quick way to identify reliability issues and ensure your applications maintain a smooth, dependable experience.

##### Error Records

This table logs all recorded errors and when clicking on an individual record, you are sent to the trace where the error originated.

##### Logs

This panel lists all Temporal-related logs. Teams can use this for deep troubleshooting, auditing usage patterns, and correlating issues with specific request flows. Clicking on a row links back to the corresponding log entry for full traceability.


#### Agents

##### Agent Distribution

This panel shows the distribution of various agents being used within Temporal, helping you understand which agents are most active and how adoption is spread across different agent types in your implementation.

##### Agents List

This panel lists all agents called within the Temporal execution. Each entry contains the agent name along with number of requests made to that tool and the average latency for the duration of the agent.


##### Agent Traces

This panel displays all traces generated by selected agents, with each entry linking directly to the full trace.


#### Temporal Cloud

##### Temporal Poll Success Rate

This chart tracks the percentage of successful polls made by workers to retrieve tasks from queues, helping you identify connection issues and ensure efficient task distribution across your Temporal infrastructure.

##### Worker Poll Success Sync Rate

This chart monitors the rate of successful synchronous polls over time, revealing how effectively workers are staying in sync with available work.

##### Worker Poll Timeout Rate

This chart displays the frequency of timeouts when workers fail to receive responses within the expected timeframe—alerting you to potential network issues, server congestion, or misconfigurations before they impact task execution.
